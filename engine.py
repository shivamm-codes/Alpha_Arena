AGENTS WAR - backtest engine.  DO NOT EDIT (organizers use the same file to score you).

How it works, in plain words:
  * First the engine calls your  train(data)  ONCE, with only the days in your TRAIN_WINDOW
    (at most 10 years = 2520 days). Learn whatever you need there.
  * Then, every day after the market closes, it calls your  decide(history).
  * `history` holds only the last year (252 days) up to and including today -
    you can never see the future, and you cannot re-learn from the full data inside decide.
  * You return how much of your money to put in each stock (a "weight").
  * Your portfolio earns those stocks' returns from today's close to tomorrow's close.
  * Every change in weights pays a trading cost.
